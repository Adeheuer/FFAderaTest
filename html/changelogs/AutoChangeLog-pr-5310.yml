changes:
  - rscadd: "Interdyne Pharmaceutics rejoins the Syndicate, as specified in the new flavour text for corresponding off-station roles."
  - rscadd: "Both Interdyne outpost and DS-2 now feature independent research & development networks, completely separated from the station, allowing their scientists to actually have stuff to do. Syndicate-flavoured research nodes will be added to said networks in future updates."
  - map: "Remapped the Interdyne outpost: shield generator replaced with an armory section and Deck Officer's quarters; moved some workstations around for convenient access; added a prison cell next to personnel spawners; default machinegun turrets replaced with heavy turrets."
  - map: "Global rework of DS-2: now looks more like a starship rather than an alagmation of poor design choices; once more has a functional medblock; armory restocked with C-20A carabines instead of Sindano submachine guns; added LTSRBT circuts to a secure storage for the crew's use."
