These create small (or not so small) electromagnetic pulses on impact, in return for dealing much less direct damage. .38 Haywire can be fabricated with an ammo workbench with appropriate designs, or from techfabs with Exotic Ammunition. .357 Haywire+ can be bought from the uplink or fabricated with the ammo workbench with appropriate designs."
