changes:
  - rscadd: "A pair of new energy weapons has been added to replace microfusion lasers, the modular energy weapons. Coming in both long and short versions, these persona-enabled weapons have many different modes they can rapidly reconfigure themselves between to fit whatever the operator's preferences may be."
  - rscdel: "Microfusion lasers entirely have been deleted. There are no more. Good news, however, is that the highly curious non-modular code edits that were a result of microfusion lasers are now gone."
