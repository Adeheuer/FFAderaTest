  - balance: "Forged Armor was improved all around, made more significant and less grindy to upgrade (6 pieces for a full set vs 12).  While it no longer reachs Drake Armor levels of Melee protection, its other stats make it more formidable and useful for the day to day."
  - rscadd: "Chainshirt added to the forging workbench, as an alternative for the Plate mail, less focused on melee and bullets, more on energy types. Not to be confused with the Heartkin Chainshirt, which has the same stats as the platemail."
