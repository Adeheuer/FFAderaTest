2023-11-01:
  GPeckman:
  - bugfix: The fire visual on mobs should no longer persist after the fire has been
      extinguished.
  LT3:
  - code_imp: Changing security levels will only trigger the nightshift subsystem
      if lighting changes are required
  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.
  NotDhu:
  - bugfix: Blueshift's white ship docking port should now work correctly.
  Pickle-Coding:
  - bugfix: Fixes tesla zaps being weird.
  - admin: Logs explosions from explosive zaps.
  Profakos:
  - refactor: Traders are basic mobs now. Please alert us of any strange behaviours!
  - code_imp: If there is only one option, radial lists will autopick it. This behaviour
      can be turned off via a new argument.
  SethLafuente:
  - rscadd: Added Abnormal Eggs
  - rscadd: Added Two new spiders
  - rscdel: Some Tarantula abilities
  - balance: Spiders speed are now connected to health
  - balance: Spiders now take more brute damage
  - balance: All egg laying now has a cooldown
  SyncIt21:
  - bugfix: Cargo will remove/cancel orders from its cart if that order exceeds the
      available budget (both private or cargo) and the player cannot cancel this order
      manually. All order costs are rounded up to integer values
  - bugfix: Galactic material market will deny appending stacks to your existing order
      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)
      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material
      market UI is overall improved.
  - bugfix: Plumbing IV Drip has full control over its injection/draining rate. No
      longer displays the message controlled by plumbing system
  - bugfix: Plumbing IV Drip can be plunged by plunger again
  honkpocket:
  - code_imp: The xeno hybrid tongue now actually looks and sounds like the alien
      tongue
  jlsnow301:
  - bugfix: Paraplegics can now enter netpods.
  - bugfix: Fixes an exploit caused by teleporting out of a netpod.
  - bugfix: Outfit selection at netpods shouldn't give armor bonuses any longer.
  lizardqueenlexi:
  - refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a little smarter
      in combat, and if you're wearing your ID they'll siphon your bank account with
      every melee attack! Beware! Please report any bugs.
  - refactor: Wraith constructs have been converted to the basic mob framework. NPC
      wraiths are now extra cruel and will attack the lowest-health mob they can see
      at any given time. Make sure this isn't you! Please report any bugs.
  - bugfix: Artificers and juggernauts no longer attack significantly more slowly
      than intended.
  mc-oofert:
  - rscadd: living floor, living flesh, and other stuff for the bioresearch outpost
      ruin
  - rscadd: bioresearch outpost ruin
  - bugfix: you may not defeat indestructible grilles and windows with mere tools
  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Operatives can once again read about the basics of CQC at a reasonable
      price of 14 TC.
  - qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on their
      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
      their baseline equipment NOW.
