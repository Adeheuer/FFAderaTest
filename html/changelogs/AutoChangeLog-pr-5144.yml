changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds a new multitool, the 'full override control kit', which aside from working as a regular multitool, allows the user to hack open or unlock APC's and Air Alarms. They do so rather aggresively, so it can break them with enough uses. They can be obtained from the premium section of YouTool or from broad band enabled AKH Frontier Imports."
  - qol: "YouTool vendors premium section now holds the F.O.C.K., as well as a small selection of AKH frontier hand held devices. It is said that some vendors are being used to smuggle Prybars though. Multitools are now being sold at a discount!"
  - balance: "Prybars can no longer be made in the Rapid Construction Fabricator, Large Crowbars now instead take their place, removing the heavy taxes on the RCF and making it no longer restricted."
