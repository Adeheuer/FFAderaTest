  - image: "A whole list of icons have been set back to TG due to resprites improving quality: the E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR, Buckets/Wooden Buckets, Emergency Medkits (in O2 Lockers), and all the remaining overridden Atmospherics wall-mounts."
  - image: "A few Box drawings have been updated, and the fishing boxes now have modular drawings so they don't revert back to TG's box icons."
