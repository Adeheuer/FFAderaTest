  - bugfix: "Retracting your MODsuit with an ash accretion module enabled disables the benefits from the module."
  - balance: "The mining MODsuit, with full ash, negates its own slowdown and has 60 melee armor, comparable to the explorer suit."
  - balance: "The Nakamura MODs import company no longer has ash accretion modules in stock."
  - code_imp: "Moved some overrides to the master files folder, instead of being in... the company imports folder."
