changes:
  - rscadd: "Added the new P207 to both cargo sol imports and security vendors, its a completly non lethal pistol that shoots bouncy balls that are more effective against armor than the usual rubber ammunition, comparable to regular ammo.  It's ammo its easy enough to produce that autolathes and sec lathes can print it out from start."
  - qol: "Added two pepperball guns to security vendors along with its ammo, increased how much the ammo box holds to 18 and fixed the issue that prevented it from being printable on the sec lathe."
  - bugfix: "Lower cases the text of ammo boxes to be consistent."
